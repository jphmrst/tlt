# Changelog for TLT

- 0.2.0 :: Divided the `tlt` function for running tests, to separate
  `tltCore` for just running tests from formatted output of test
  results.  The former is intended for running TLT in other
  frameworks.

  - Release 0.2.0.0 also prunes some unneeded dependencies.

- 0.1.0 :: First release.  Patch 1 re-arranged documentation.
